# KMap Minimization for 4 variables
 
The following code gives minimised Boolean expression for 2,3 and 4 input variables with dont care conditions. No algorithm is used for implementing instead all things have been coded as per understanding of KMaps. Time complexity was not the constraint here and only correct functionality was intended.

# Input format
Append #print(minFunc(4,'(7)d(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)')) this to the code to see the result.
minFunc is already implemented. 4 is the number fo variables. You then have to specify which minterm is 1 and which are dont cares which will be specified after d. This command will give you the minimised Boolean expression.
